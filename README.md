Slim prompt theme for [Starship](https://starship.rs/) designed to work with dark terminal themes.

## Install

1. Download the `.toml` theme of your choice
   * Use `brilliant-warp.toml` for Warp terminal due to special spacing handling

   * Add the path to the `.toml` in your shell profile:

        ```bash
        export STARSHIP_CONFIG=~/path/to/brilliant.toml

   * Or create a `~/.config/starship.toml` and copy-paste the contents of the `.toml` into it.
3. Enjoy!
